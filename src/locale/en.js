      1: 'Currently, there is a growing speculative demand for ready-made deposits of block granite in the Russian Federation market due to the lack of quality stone.',
      2: 'We want to partially meet this demand, receiving multiple returns for us and our investors.',
      3: 'Along the way, we want to deal with the following problems:',
      4: '1. The bowels of the Russian Federation, with all their wealth, belong to the people (according to the law) and are distributed by the state. In fact, only major businessmen and officials have access to them. And the further, the richer the rich become, the poorer the poor.',
      5: 'With the help of the blockchain, we want to enable small and medium-sized investors to participate in the process of using the people`s wealth and get a profit from it.',
      6: '2. By attracting a wide range of possible investors and facilitating communication between the participants in the process, automation of allocation of investments and profits, we want to increase the efficiency and reduce the time of search and collection of investments for our project, then applying the model for any subsoil use project in Russia.',
      7: '3. In the life cycle of the field there are multiple changes of owners. We want to create an information and document base on the deposits of this and the following projects in the detachment, which in future will make it easier for potential buyers to make the right decisions on buying and selling, transferring rights, pledge and other activities related to the project`s fields.',
      8: 'The using of blockchain technology will make it possible to work more efficiently in the market, ensuring a qualitative and quantitative breakthrough in the entire sphere of subsoil use in Russia.'
